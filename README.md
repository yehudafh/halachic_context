# Halachic Context ‚Äì Home Assistant Integration

A Home Assistant custom integration that adds sensors to determine the **halachic (Jewish law) context** of the current day, such as whether it's a regular weekday, a holiday or Shabbat night/day, and whether **Tachanun (supplicatory prayer)** should be recited today.

- `tachanun_status`: Determines if Tachanun should be said today according to standard **siddur rules**, based only on the Hebrew date.
